  The Huguenot-Walloon half dollar is a commemorative coin issued by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1924. It ma
  rks the 300th anniversary of the voyage of the Nieuw Nederland. Many of the passengers were Protestants, Huguenots from
   France or Walloons from Belgium; they became early settlers of New York State and the surrounding areas. A bill to autho
   rize the coin passed through Congress without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding. Sketches
   were prepared by Rev. John Baer Stoudt and converted to plaster models by the Mint's chief engraver, George T. Morgan. Of th
   e 300,000 coins authorized by Congress, fewer than half were actually struck, and of these, 55,000 were returned to the Mint an
   d released into circulation. The coin excited some controversy because of its sponsorship by a religious group. The coins are cu
   rrently valued in the hundreds of dollars, depending on condition.
